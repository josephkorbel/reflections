What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you create an empty repository. You need to do it so you can add new content to your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermedium between the working directory and the repository. It is a way to make sure that you don't accidently add changes you didn't mean to to the repository and group things together logically before commiting them.
